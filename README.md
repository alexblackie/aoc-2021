These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021][0] challenges. This year I
chose to use it as an opportunity to gain more experience with .NET and C#.

## Development

Install the .NET Core 6 SDK, and then you can:

```
$ dotnet restore
```

to install dependencies.

Then you can run the app, which will output each day's answers:

```
$ dotnet run
```

There is a (hopefully) exhaustive xUnit unit test suite:

```
$ dotnet test
```
